## About The Project

Gundling is an action-packed 2D shooter game developed in the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language with
graphics powered by the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library. In the game, you take control of a centrally
positioned gun. Waves of enemies appear every second, and each hit from them reduces your health. Your goal is to
survive these relentless attacks for as long as possible. Brace yourself for an intense battle and strive to fight till
the last breath!
